def is_independent_system(matrix):

    Check if a linear system of equations can be split into independent one-dimensional problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix : numpy.ndarray
        A rectangular matrix representing coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the system can be split into independent one-dimensional problems, False otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    This function checks whether a linear system of equations in the form of `matrix [operator] right_hand_side`
    can be split into independent one-dimensional problems. The number of problems is determined by the
    number of variables (the row number of the matrix).

    Each problem consists of a coefficient vector and a right-hand side. The system can be considered independent
    if each row of the matrix has exactly one non-zero coefficient or no non-zero coefficients.

def yield_one_d_systems(matrix, right_hand_side):
    """
    Split a linear system of equations (<=, >=, or ==) into independent one-dimensional problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matrix : numpy.ndarray
        A rectangular matrix representing coefficients.
    right_hand_side : numpy.ndarray
        The right-hand side vector.

    Yields
    ------
    tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]
        A tuple containing a coefficient vector and the corresponding right-hand side.

    Notes
    -----
    The independence of the problems is NOT explicitly checked; call `is_independent_system` before using this
    function if unsure.

    This function takes a linear system of equations in the form of `matrix [operator] right_hand_side`,
    where "matrix" is a rectangular matrix, "x" is a vector of variables, and "right_hand_side" is
    the right-hand side vector. It splits the system into assumed independent one-dimensional problems.

    Each problem consists of a coefficient vector and a right-hand side. The number of problems is equal to the
    number of variables (the row number of the matrix).

    Example
    -------
    ```python
    for A, b in yield_one_d_systems(matrix, right_hand_side):
        # Solve the one-dimensional problem A * x = b
        solution = solve_one_d_system(A, b)

    Solve a linear system of equations using back substitution for an upper triangular square matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    upper_triangular_square_matrix : numpy.ndarray
        An upper triangular square matrix (R).

    right_hand_side : numpy.ndarray
        A vector (y) on the right-hand side of the equation Rx = y.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The solution vector (x) to the system of equations Rx = y.

    Notes
    -----
    The function performs back substitution to find the solution vector x for the equation Rx = y,
    where R is an upper triangular square matrix and y is a vector. The division_operation
    function is used for division (e.g., for custom division operations).

    The function assumes that the upper right element of the upper_triangular_square_matrix (R)
    is nonzero for proper back substitution.

    Calculate the Row Echelon Form (REF) of a matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        The input matrix for which the REF is to be calculated.

    Notes
    -----
    - If the input matrix has no rows or columns, it is already in REF, and the function returns itself.
