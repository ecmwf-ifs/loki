Batch processing abstraction for processing large source trees with Loki.

This sub-package provides the :any:`Scheduler` class that allows Loki
transformations to be applied over large source trees. For this it
provides the basic :any:`Transformation` and :any:`Pipeline` classes
that provide the core interfaces for batch processing, as well as the
configuration utilities for large call tree traversals.
