class CMakePlanTransformation(Transformation):
    """
    Gather the planning information from all :any:`Item.trafo_data` to which
    this information is applied and allows writing a CMake plan file

    This requires that :any:`FileWriteTransformation` has been applied in planning
    mode first.

    Applying this transformation to a :any:`Item` updates internal lists:

    * :attr:`sources_to_transform`: The path of all source files that contain
      objects that are transformed by a Loki transformation in the pipeline
    * :attr:`sources_to_append`: The path of any new source files that exist
      as a consequence of the Loki transformation pipeline, e.g., transformed
      source files that are written.
    * :attr:`sources_to_remove`: The path of any existing source files that
      are to be removed from the compilation target. This includes all items
      that don't have the :any:`Item.replicate` property.

    The :any:`Sourcefile.path` is used to determine the file path from which a
    Fortran sourcefile was read. New paths are provided in
    ``item.trafo_data['FileWriteTransformation']['path']``.

    The method :meth:`write_plan` allows to write the gathered information to
    a CMake file that can be included in the CMake scripts that build a library.
    The plan file is a CMake file defining three lists matching the above:

    * ``LOKI_SOURCES_TO_TRANSFORM``: The list of files that are
        processed in the dependency graph
    * ``LOKI_SOURCES_TO_APPEND``: The list of files that are created
        and have to be added to the build target as part of the processing
    * ``LOKI_SOURCES_TO_REMOVE``: The list of files that are no longer
        required (because they have been replaced by transformed files) and
        should be removed from the build target.

    These lists are used by the Loki CMake wrappers (particularly
    ``loki_transform_target``) to schedule the source updates and update the
    source lists of the CMake target object accordingly.
