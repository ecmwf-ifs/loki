"""
The basic Single Column Coalesced (SCC) transformation with
vector-level kernel parallelism.

This tranformation will convert kernels with innermost vectorisation
along a common horizontal dimension to a GPU-friendly loop-layout via
loop inversion and local array variable demotion. The resulting kernel
remains "vector-parallel", but with the ``horizontal`` loop as the
outermost iteration dimension (as far as data dependencies
allow). This allows local temporary arrays to be demoted to scalars,
where possible.

The outer "driver" loop over blocks is used as the secondary dimension
of parallelism, where the outher data indexing dimension
(``block_dim``) is resolved in the first call to a "kernel"
routine. This is equivalent to a so-called "gang-vector" parallisation
scheme.

This :any:`Pipeline` applies the following :any:`Transformation`
classes in sequence:
1. :any:`SCCBaseTransformation` - Ensure utility variables and resolve
   problematic code constructs.
2. :any:`SCCDevectorTransformation` - Remove horizontal vector loops.
3. :any:`SCCDemoteTransformation` - Demote local temporary array
   variables where appropriate.
4. :any:`SCCRevectorTransformation` - Re-insert the vecotr loops outermost,
   according to identified vector sections.
5. :any:`SCCAnnotateTransformation` - Annotate loops according to
   programming model (``directive``).

Parameters
----------
horizontal : :any:`Dimension`
    :any:`Dimension` object describing the variable conventions used in code
    to define the horizontal data dimension and iteration space.
block_dim : :any:`Dimension`
    Optional ``Dimension`` object to define the blocking dimension
    to use for hoisted column arrays if hoisting is enabled.
directive : string or None
    Directives flavour to use for parallelism annotations; either
    ``'openacc'`` or ``None``.
trim_vector_sections : bool
    Flag to trigger trimming of extracted vector sections to remove
    nodes that are not assignments involving vector parallel arrays.
demote_local_arrays : bool
    Flag to trigger local array demotion to scalar variables where possible

"""
Alternative Single Column Coalesced (SCC) transformation that
retains sequential kernels and vectorises calls and remaining
vector-sections in the driver.

This tranformation will convert kernels with innermost vectorisation
along a common horizontal dimension to a GPU-friendly loop-layout by
stripping the horizontal dimension from all called kernel routines
and demoting local array variables. The resulting kernel
is marked as "routine seq", and a vector loop is inserted around the
outermost call to a kernel call tree.

The outer "driver" loop over blocks is used as the secondary dimension
of parallelism, where the outher data indexing dimension
(``block_dim``) is resolved in the first call to a "kernel"
routine. This is equivalent to a so-called "gang-vector" parallisation
scheme. The outer gang loop can also be marked with an explicit
vector-length attribute to force warp-alignment for individual blocks.

classes in sequence:
1. :any:`SCCBaseTransformation` - Ensure utility variables and resolve
