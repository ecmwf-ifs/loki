"""
Inter-procedural analysis passes to derive and augment argument array shapes.

A pair of utility :any:`Transformation` classes that allows thea shape
of array arguments with deferred dimensions to be derived from the
calling context via inter-procedural analysis.

To infer the declared dimensions of array arguments
:any:`ArgumentArrayShapeAnalysis` needs to be applied first to set the
``shape`` property on respective :any:`Array` symbols, before
:any:`ExplicitArgumentArrayShapeTransformation` can be applied in a
reverse traversal order to apply the necessary changes to argument
declarations and call signatures.

    Infer shape of array arguments with deferred shape.

    An inter-procedural analysis pass that passively infers the shape
    symbols for argument arrays from calling contexts and sets the
    ``shape`` attribute on :any:`Array` symbols accordingly.

    The shape information is propagated from a caller to the called
    subroutine in a forward traversal of the call-tree. If the
    call-side shape of an array argument is either set, or has already
    been derived (possibly with conflicting information), this
    transformation will have no effect.

    Note: This transformation does not affect the generated source
    code, as it only sets the ``shape`` property, which is ignored
    during the code generation step (:any:`fgen`). To actively change
    the argument array declarations and the resulting source code, the
    :any:`ExplicitArgumentArrayShapeTransformation` needs to be applied
    `after` this transformation.
